# 🖐️ Sign Language Detection & Translation  

This project translates **Indian Sign Language (ISL) into Telugu text and audio** using **OpenCV and Mediapipe**. The goal is to bridge the communication gap for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community by providing real-time sign language recognition.  

## ✨ Features  
- 📷 **Real-time Sign Detection** using **OpenCV & Mediapipe**  
- 🔤 **ISL to Telugu Translation** (Text & Speech Output)  
- 🌍 **Multi-language Support** (Upcoming: English, Hindi, more!)  
- 🏥 **Telemedicine Integration** – Enhancing doctor-patient communication  
- 📞 **Live Online Translation** – Support for video calls & Skype-like meetings  

## 🏗️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** (OpenCV, Mediapipe)  
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** for audio output  
- **Machine Learning** for gesture classification  

## 🚀 Future Enhancements  
- Extend support to **more sign languages**  
- Implement **live translation for video calls**  
- Improve **real-time accuracy and speed**
